# Azure-Website-App-2024
Create a repository project folder to practice posting a website on Azure
Branching lets you have different versions of a repository at one time.
By default, your repository has one branch named main that is considered to be the definitive branch. 
You can create additional branches off of main in your repository.
The work done on different branches will not show up on the main branch until you merge it, which we will cover later in this guide. 
You can use branches to experiment and make edits before committing them to main
When you create a branch off the main branch, you're making a copy, or snapshot, of main as it was at that point in time. 
If someone else made changes to the main branch while you were working on your branch, you could pull in those updates.

Above is a copy or snapshot of the main branch's readme.md. Now we are in this copied feature/version branch called readme.md-edits 
and added this line with the code editor. This will be followed by clicking Commit changes. And...
These changes will be made only to the README file on your readme-edits branch, so now this branch contains content that's different from main.
